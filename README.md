# FreshyCart---.NET-Core-Fullstack

**Brief Description:** This repository contains all the folder and files for the FreshyCart project I have decided to launch. 
It will contains all the various stages of the the project starting from the Login and Register page, then the Product Page and all that comes with it, then the Cart page.

## Updates will go as follows:
1. Login and Register page project will be the first to be uploaded.
2. Product page which I showcased in my LinkedIn will be next to be uploaded. 
3. Cart page will be the last of the individuals project to be uploaded as that is the one with the most work. 
4. The full completed project will be the last thing I upload. 

## Purpose: 
I have been learning about .NET Core these past couple of months. I thought it would be a 
great way for me to showcase that I know how to use this technology and solidify my knowledge with this technology by taking on 
this challenge.
